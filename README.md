# Patient-with-abnormal-blood-pressure
In this project, we predicted abnormal blood pressure using patient data. We cleaned the data by handling null values and removing irrelevant columns, then converted categorical features using Label Encoding. Starting with Logistic Regression (51.5% accuracy), we improved performance with Decision Tree (84%) and XGBoost (90%).
